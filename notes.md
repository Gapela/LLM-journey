# STEPS OF MACHINE LEARNING
- Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
- Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
- Predict: Just what it sounds like
- Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.

## Define
You need to define which model do you will use and which metrics you gona choose. Then, treat all this data with some lib/software that make this job.

## Fit
This part is about to literally FIT data into the modeling parameters.
For example, if you choose to use sklearn, in the lib Decision Tree, you can use the method fit() to fit the data.

## Predict
As its name says, this part is about to predict the data. You can use the same lib/software that you used in the fit step. For example, if you used sklearn, you can use the method predict() to predict the data.

## Evaluate
Similar to the fit step, you can use the same lib/software that you used in the fit step. For example, if you used sklearn, you can use the method score() to evaluate the data.
